Two new settings can now be configured in the app config panel:

- Enable/Disable the user notifications for all users: On large instances, it is recommended to set this option to 'false' in order to reduce the amount of data written to the database, and hence improve the overall performance of the instance.
- Banner: Custom banner displayed at the top of every page. This can used for instance announcements. Accepted values: any string. HTML is accepted. Empty by default.
